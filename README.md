# Heart Disease Prediction Application

Application Link: https://yohanv1-heart-disease-prediction-application.streamlit.app

This is a web application for predicting heart disease based on user-provided input using three different learning algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. It's built using the Streamlit library and is designed to help users assess their risk of heart disease quickly.

* Decision Trees: This model makes predictions based on a decision tree algorithm.
* Random Forest: This model uses an ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy.
* XGBoost: This model utilizes gradient boosting for robust predictions.
